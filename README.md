This is my Final Year Project - SuperNormal, a multiplayer cat-and-mouse game where players are divided into 2 groups, SuperNormies and Normies. SuperNormies possess special abilities and they have to pretend they are normal people by not acting suspicious and try to blend in as the other NPCs. They can either complete all the missions or survive for 10 minutes until the game ends in order to win the game. Normies are normal people who have special equipments that help them in identifying the SuperNormies and all they have to do is eliminate all the SuperNormies before they complete their missions within 10 minutes to win the game.

Special Features:</br>
⦁ Special game modes such as 1v1 and 2v2 to allow you to play with your friends according to the number of players. </br>
⦁ Guess what? You can also play this game either a VR device or a PC device as this game supports cross-platform gameplay. </br>
⦁ Players can experience different abilities that does not exist in real life. </br>

Strength:</br>
⦁ Cross-platform support for VR and PC devices. </br>
⦁ Support up to 4 players per game. </br>
⦁ Contain variety of abilities and equipments for the player to experience. </br>

Weakness:</br>
⦁ Game still have some bugs especially NPCs behaviours.

Anyways, this final year project took me only 3 months to develop so it is not so perfect as there are still rooms for improvements such as fixing all the bugs and polishing. Any suggestions are appreciated ;)
